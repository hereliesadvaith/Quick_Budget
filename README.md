# Quick Budget
This is a budget management app built using Owl.JS for the frontend and Django for the backend. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete expenses of their day to day life. The app is built with a responsive and intuitive user interface using Owl.JS and a robust backend using Django and Django Rest Framework.

Future plans for this app include upgrading it with data science tools for self-prediction features to help users better manage their budget. These features will be added gradually as the project progresses.
